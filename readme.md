## SIT

SIT is a set of MATLAB functions for recursive system identification and adaptive controls. It is branched from Prof. Ioan Landau's toolbox in his book "Adaptive control by Landau, Lozano, M'Saad and Karimi, Springer", with modifications and adaptations to modern versions of MATLAB by Mathworks. It is maintained by Xu Chen and community contributors.
